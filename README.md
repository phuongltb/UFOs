# UFOs
Perform an analysis on UFO sightings using Javascript and HTML

## Overview of Project
This project is to provide an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time, including the date, the city, state, country, and shape. 
  - Deliverable 1: Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria
  - Deliverable 2: A written report on the UFO analysis

## Results
When you run index.html on any web browser, the webpage will be loaded with UFO sightings information. Users can search for UFO sightings of a specific date, city, state, country, and/or shape. These filters can be found as Filter Search at the left hand side of the webpage as shown in the screenshot below:

Examples of how to search for UFO sightings using Filter Search:
  - Search by Date: Enter a particular date in the field "Enter a Date" and press TAB, the table data will be filtered to display only records on that date. For example, the screenshot below shows data on 1/2/2010

  - Search by City: Enter a particular city in the field "Enter a City" and press TAB, the table data will be filtered to display only records of that city. For example, the screenshot below shows data of the city "La mesa"

  - Search by State: Enter a particular state in the field "Enter a State" and press TAB, the table data will be filtered to display only records of that state. For example, the screenshot below shows data of the state "or"

  - Search by Country: Enter a particular country in the field "Enter a Country" and press TAB, the table data will be filtered to display only records of that country. For example, the screenshot below shows data in Canada

  - Search by UFO shape: Enter a particular shape in the field "Enter a Shape" and press TAB, the table data will be filtered to display only UFOs in that shape. For example, the screenshot below shows data of circle UFOs

## Summary
One drawback of this design is that users have to enter value to search for UFO sightings data. It would be more convenient if users can choose filters from dropdown lists of values. Therefore, the following would be recommended as further developments for filter search:
 - Replace filters text boxes by dropdown lists for city, state, country, and shape 
 - Provide a calendar at the textbox "Enter a Date" for users to choose a date
